👋 Hi, I’m @koeksama
Currently I am studying a few code langluages at school. Becomming a "Jack of all traits but a master of none isn't what I plan on doing and making my own hardware like RFID doorlocks and such is just my thing.
If you want to do a project together 💞️ contact me and we will see what we can conjour.
